# Java Projects

Welcome to the **Java Projects** repository! This is a collection of beginner to intermediate-level Java programs that explore a variety of programming concepts such as object-oriented design, file I/O, data structures, and more.

Each folder contains a standalone Java project with its own purpose and logic.

## üìÅ Project List

### 1. **2048 Game**
A recreation of the iconic 2038 game, utilizing Java Swing Graphics to create an interactice display

- **Concepts:** Classes, Graphics, Event Handling, 2D Array Operations
- **Features:** Displays 4x4 board, responds to user arrowkey inputs, tracks win/lose states

---

### 2. **3D/4D Render**
Uses geometric projection to display 3D and 4D Structures that can rotate on any main axis

- **Concepts:** Geometric Projection, Objects, Graphics, Matrix Operations
- **Features:** Defines points in 3D or 4D space, then draws lines between them and rotates them about given axis

- **Features:** Random board configuration, infinite gameplay loop, interactive board

---

### 4. **Maze Generator**
Takes user input for maze size, then generates one and finds solution

- **Concepts:** 2D Arrays, Depth First Search(DFS), random generation, user input
- **Features:** Takes user input, generates maze, solves upon hitting enter

---

### 5. **MineSweeper**
A simple version of the classic game using Java

- **Concepts:** 2D Array Operations, Recurrsion, event handling, Graphics
